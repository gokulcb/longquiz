**Mini-Project:** Scalable Machine Learning Pipeline with Dask

**Project Title:** Building a Scalable Machine Learning Pipeline with Dask

**Objective:** To construct a scalable machine learning pipeline capable of handling large
datasets, using Dask.

**Tasks:**

**Dataset Selection:** Choose a large dataset for a machine learning task (e.g., image
classification, text analysis).

**Dask Setup:** Set up a Dask environment suitable for distributed computing.

**Data Preprocessing:** Implement data preprocessing steps using Dask's dataframes or
arrays.

**Model Training:** Train a machine learning model using Dask-ML or integrate Dask with
an existing ML library.

**Performance Analysis:** Compare the scalability and efficiency of the Dask pipeline
against a traditional approach.

**Visualization:** Implement visualization tools to display the performance and results of
the machine learning model.

**Deliverables:** Dask-based machine learning pipeline code, performance analysis
report, result visualizations, and comprehensive documentation.
